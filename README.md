Currency Converter


Project Overview


The Currency Converter is a C++ console application that allows users to convert between various currencies. The application uses predefined exchange rates to perform conversions and provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the input and output currencies. This project demonstrates basic concepts of C++ such as functions, control structures, and file handling (if the rates are loaded from a file).
